A package manager is a tool that automates the process of installing, updating, and removing packages. Conda, with its "conda install", "conda update", and "conda remove" sub-commands, falls squarely under this definition. 

Conda is a general-purpose package management system, designed to build and manage software of any type from any language. As such, it also works well with Python packages.

Conda is a language-agnostic cross-platform environment manager that installs any package within conda environments.

This repository provides a conda recipe for packaging SNAP as a conda package.

The goal of SNAP as a conda package is to ease the unattended installation of SNAP and snappy in headless environments such as Linux consoles or docker images. 

This goal is achieved by creating conda packages installing SNAP and snappy, published on a public conda channel.
